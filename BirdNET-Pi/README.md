# Here is what you're gonna do

- Replace server.py in the scripts directory of your BirdNET-Pi installation (probably /home/pi/BirdNET/scripts) with the one from this directory.
- But first back up the old one
- Edit server.py and replace the value of ANALYSIS_SERVER and ANALYSIS_PORT with that of your BirdNET-Analyzer server
- Rebooting the Pi or VM would probably be the next best course of action
